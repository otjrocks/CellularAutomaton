### Running the Program

* Main class: Main.java

* Data files needed:
    * All required Data files can be found in the main resources directory.
        * Optional cell state color properties can be found in the property file
          `/resources/cellsociety/colors/CellColors.properties`
            * If a color is not defined in this properties file, a random color will be assigned to
              a state when the simulation is first opened
    * Darwin instructions are stored in the
      `/resources/cellsociety/darwin instructions/DInstructions.properties`
    * The required fonts for the UI are found in the `/resources/cellsociety/fonts/` directory. Any
      ttf font can
      be used, so long as there is a file named bold.ttf and regular.ttf for the bold and regular
      font.
    * All of the support languages are stored in `/resources/cellsociety/languages`. By default,
      there is an
      English, PigLatin, and Spanish language file. To create a new language, see CREATE_LANGUAGE.md
      in this directory.
    * The default themes are included in the `/resources/cellsociety/themes/`. To create a custom
      theme, create a CSS file in this directory, following the guide in CREATE_THEME.md
    * The file `/resources/cellsociety/styles.css` contains all the common styles that are shared
      across all themes.
    * The file `/resources/log4j2.xml` is required to properly configure the Log4j2 logging that is
      utilized by this program.
    * The file `/resources/cellsociety/default.xml` is the required default simulation file. This is
      used primarily for testing and to prevent any null pointer exceptions when creating the
      initial UI elements.

* Interesting data files:
    * All of our custom example xml files can be found in the `/resources/simulations` directory.
      This directory contains examples for each of the simulation types, the different cell shapes,
      different edge types, randomly created simulations, and examples with missing or invalid
      files.

* Key/Mouse inputs:
* The user can interact with the UI via multiple clearly labeled buttons, selector fields,
  checkboxes, and text input fields. If the program has more content that what can be viewed in the
  main window, a scroll bar will be created, allowing the user to scroll to view the remaining
  content.
* You can click on a cell in the simulation to get information about it in the view mode or to
  change its state in the edit mode.
* You can change the zoom of the simulation grid, by putting your mouse in the grid area and swiping
  with 2 fingers on the trackpad at once. To reset the zoom to the default, you can click the reset
  zoom button on the sidebar.

### Notes/Assumptions

* Assumptions or Simplifications:
    * The state of a simulation is stored as an integer value.
        * The default state for a simulation is assumed to be 0 and simulation states are a positive
          integer value.
        * The number of states method lets the front end know how many states to expect. For
          example, if the number of states is 3, then the valid states should be 0 (default), 1, 2.
    * We assumed the typical usage of Percolation such that water flows from the top and only
      considers the adjacent neighbors (not the diagonals).
    * In WaTor World, we assumed that the sharks will be processed first, so if a shark moves to a
      cell before a fish moves, the fish will be removed and will not have the opportunity to move.
      Thus, we process sharks first, then as long as the fish cells are untouched, we move those to
      new cells.
    * Reproduction of sharks and fish occurs one iteration after there reproduction time has passed.
      For example, if the reproductive time of a shark is set to 2, then it will move around for its
      first 2 iterations of life and then reproduce on its third iteration/step of life.
    * For RockPaperScissors, we assumed that for any x number of states, the current state will lose
      to the n/2 numbers before it, and beat the n/2 winners ahead of it (in the circular route).
      Furthermore, to determine the next state of a cell, if more than 1 cell are above the
      threshold, we will update the cell with the furthest winning cell. By this, we mean that in
      the n/2 cells that beat the current state, we will take the furthest cell from the current
      state.

    * We assumed the typical usage of Percolation such that water flows from the top and only
      considers the adjacent neighbors (not the diagonals).
    * In WaTor World, we assumed that the sharks will be processed first, so if a shark moves to a
      cell before a fish moves, the fish will be removed and will not have the opportunity to move.
      Thus, we process sharks first, then as long as the fish cells are untouched, we move those to
      new cells.
    * We assumed that the grid state should only be modifiable when the user is in our "edit mode,"
      so that users do not unintentionally modify the simulation. However, only a single if
      statement would need to be changed to allow grid state updating while the simulation is
      running.
    * In Foraging Ants, we assume there can only be one ant per state and that ants cannot travel in
      a diagonal path. Ants are produced from ant hills after a number of turns specified by the
      user.
    * In Falling Sand, if a sand cell is able to moved directly down, it will automatically move
      down. If it can only move to its left or right diagonal, it will randomly choose one of the
      diagonals if both of them are empty. If only one diagonal is empty and it cannot fall directly
      down, it will move to the only open diagonal.
    * In Sugarscape, an agent's metabolism will always be subtracted before checking its neighbors.
      Thus, it must have sufficient metabolism prior to movement. Then, it determines the maximum
      sugar patch within its vision. It breaks ties using a minimum distance.
    * The tooltip feature to show the state for a given cell will only be displayed when the
      animation is not running and when the user is not in edit mode. This is to not annoy the user
      of the tool tip constantly showing when they put their mouse in the grid area.
    * In Darwin, we assume that for each move instruction, each pixel represents one block in our
      simulation. So, for example, a MOVE 4, will move 4 blocks, rather than simply four pixels. We
      also assume that degrees will get rounded to the nearest 45 degree. So if, somebody inputs
      something like 30 degrees, we round that handle the orientation differently depedning on if
      the neighbor configuration is Moore or Von Neumann. So, for 30 degrees and 0 degree initial
      orientation, a right turn for Moore rounds to 45 degrees, while a right turn for Von Neumann
      rounds to 0 degrees.

* Known Bugs:
    * For Hexagon and Triangle shapes, there may be slight gaps in between the shapes, due to
      rounding
      of double values for their location. This may make it appear like there are grid lines even
      when grid lines is disabled.
    * Sometimes when changing the theme, some of the text in the UI has an update glitch where the
      text alignment shifts from centered to right or left aligned.
